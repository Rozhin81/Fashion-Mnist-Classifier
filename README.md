# Fashion-Mnist-Classifier

A simple yet effective deep learning project built with Keras to classify fashion items. It demonstrates the complete workflow of an image classification task using a fully-connected neural network, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.

## Overview

This project covers:

- Loading and inspecting the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Preprocessing data (normalization and one-hot encoding)
- Visualizing sample images
- Building and training a neural network using Keras
- Evaluating the model on unseen test data
- Making predictions and visualizing results
